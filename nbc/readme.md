> Fleet Foxes have always represented Autumn for me, my favorite season. They
> both present tranquility, accepting inevitable change, being at peace with the
> moment you’re in and reflecting on what happened in your past. It’s a heavy
> but welcome and revelatory feeling. So it’s so fitting they released when they did,
> right at the crest of Summer becoming Fall, when we can come to accept this
> awful year and look forward to a better one.
