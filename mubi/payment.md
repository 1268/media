Thanks for reaching out! I just increased the number of Privacy Cards you can
use with this merchant. Another attempt with this card should be successful.

For context into why you received this decline, we limit the number of Privacy
Cards that users can create for a single merchant. We do this to reduce the
risk of users violating merchant policies or terms, which could lead to the
merchant banning Privacy Cards altogether.
